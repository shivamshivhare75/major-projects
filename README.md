HII MY NAME IS SHIVAM SHIVHARE
AND NY TOPIC FOR MCT PROJECT WAS TO CLONE A MAGGIE WEBSITE AND I HAVE MENTIONED ITS LINK IN THE README FILE OF MY GITHUB REPOSITORY
SO TO CREATE THIS WEBSITE I HAVE TAKEN A MAIN DIV AND INSIDE THAT DIV I HAVE TAKEN TWO MORE DIVS AND GIVEN THEM CLASS LEFTDIV AND RIGHT DIV 
TO MAKE TH LEFT BAR I GAVE THE FLEX PROPERTY TO MAIN DIV WHICH WILL SET THESE TWO DIVS SIDE BY SIDE THUS CREATING A LEFT BAR AND RIGHT CONTENT SECTION
AND I GIVEN THE LEFT BAR POSITON AS FIXED SO 
INSIDE LEFT BAR I DIVIDED IT INTO SEVERAL DIVS AND GIVING THEM PROPERTY FLEX AND DIRECTION COLUMN SO THAT EACH DIV WILL COME ONE AFTER ANOTHER AS IT IS IN THE MAGGIE WEBSITE I USED SEVERAL CSS PROPERTIES LIKE MARGIN HEIGHT WIDHT PADDING TEXT PROPERTIES ETX TO CLONE LEFT BAR 
FOR RIGHT BAR I TOOK SEVERAL DIVS AND MAKING THE RIGHT DIV AS FLEX AND DIRECTION AS COLUMN SO THAT CONTENT CAN COME ONE AFTER ANOTHER AND I CREATED EACH DIV ONE BY ONE USING CSS PROPERTIES IT TOOK GOOD KNOWLEDGE OF CSS TO CLONE THIS SITE AND IT WAS FUN TO MAKE
